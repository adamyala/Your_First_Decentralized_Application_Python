# Your_First_Decentralized_Application_Python

This code borrows heavily from [llSourcell's turtorial](https://github.com/llSourcell/Your_First_Decentralized_Application) which in turn borrows heavily from [maheshmurthy's tutorial.](https://github.com/maheshmurthy/ethereum_voting_dapp)

Please head over to each and toss a star on the repositories. Both of them created a wonderful tutorials to learn from.

## Overview

We will be building a decentralized voting application!

The functionality of this repo is nearly identical to llSourcell's but the entire implementation is done in python!

## Setup

### Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Solidity 0.4.25+
* Node.js 10.11+

### Steps

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
1. Install the Solidity compiler, solc, on your local machine. The docs for the current version (v0.5.9) are available [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.9/installing-solidity.html). 
1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Install the [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) command line tool with `npm install -g ganache-cli`
   1. **What does this cli do?** It runs an ethereum node locally. Normally we'd have to download a lot of blockchain transactions and run a test ethereum node locally. This tool lets us run a small local node for easy peasey development. This tool used to be called the `testrpc`.
   2. **Uh... This tool isn't python...** True, but I have found the JavaScript tooling for testrpc to be fantastic and easy to use. If you don't want to bother with `npm` or just want to try out a full python stack, try out [eth-testrpc](https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc). It's pip installable but not as maintained as `ganache-cli`.

## Usage

Open up two tabs. In the first tab run `ganache-cli`. This will start a block chain locally that we can play with.

In the second tab activate your virtual environment and run `main.py`. This will start our little flask app in debug mode, deploying our contract in the process.

After the python file runs you should see something like:
```
  Transaction: 0xd3d96eb1d0b8ca8b327d0eca60ff405d0000c5cd249d06712877effbcf73095f
  Contract created: 0x9e4fab9629b8768730d107ae909567974c4c8e35
  Gas usage: 352112
  Block Number: 1
  Block Time: Sat Dec 23 2017 22:31:13 GMT+0200 (SAST)
```
in the first tab. This is your contract being deployed to the chain on your local node!

`main.py` is where the bulk of our logic happens. It deploys our smart contract to our test ethereum node and starts serving our flask app. `main.py` and `voting.sol` are heavily commented so please give those a read to understand what each is doing.

Next open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser of choice. The web application will connect to our deployed contract and use it as the backend.

Congrats! You setup your first decentralized application with python!
